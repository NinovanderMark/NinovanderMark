### Nino van der Mark
Software developer, husband, father and literal evangelist.

Working for 4DotNet as a consultant for C#/.NET, focusing on cloud-native applications.

I'm also very interested in creating video games, and looking solutions to build these and deploy clients to the following platforms:
- Windows
- Linux
- Mac
- Web (HTML/Javascript/WASM)

Once upon a time, I messed around with GitHub pages, check out what that looks like here: https://ninovandermark.github.io/
