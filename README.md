### Nino van der Mark
Software developer, husband, father and literal evangelist.

Working for 4Dotnet as a consultant for C#/.NET.

🎮 I'm also interested in video game development, with a particular focus on multi-platform and web clients.
- Certainly we must've reached the point where we don't need completely separate code-bases for each, haven't we?
